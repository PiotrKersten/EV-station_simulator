# Real-Time Charging Station Simulator

This project simulates a real-time charging station with multiple chargers, solar panels, and battery management. The simulation allows for testing different scenarios, vehicle requirements, and charging module management algorithms. It also supports manual vehicle addition via a simple GUI.

**Key Features:**
- Simulates charging station operations with multiple chargers and dynamic power management.
- Includes a GUI for adding vehicles and displaying their charging time.
- 24-hour simulation, running in 5 minutes of real-time.
- Different scenarios can be tested, including varying vehicle counts and power demands.

**Executable:**
An executable file is available in the `dist` folder for easy deployment and execution.
